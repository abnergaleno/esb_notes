Server Background :

    there are three instances run :
    (currently runs in aws.amazon.com free tier)
    
    vmAPP.aws       --> java-web-app autogenerated by wavemaker-7.8 where RESTFUL APIs can be utilized
    vmAPPprox.aws   --> ESB instance with API configuration that can adapt API specified by integra, to the wavemaker API
                        expect complex RESTFUL-url, uri.var.*, and http-body conversions 
                        all the accessible API on this server should reflect the ideal API for Integra
                        (also serves as a testing ground for ESB <--> third-party apps transformations)
    vmESB           --> should be the main ESB instance 
                        - if the API exposed on this instance is only for Integra, the API config should be far simpler
                        - will explore advance features of wso2-ESB-490 here
                        
    - since this runs on a free-tier, the instances will be stopped frequently, which mean they will change their ip addresses
    - update the file /etc/hosts, else you will not get proper response(s)
