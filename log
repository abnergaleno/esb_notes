      1) Getting authentication error : 
          
          cause : changing admin password in user-mgt.xml  will be only effective before the esb-server is initially started
                  subsequent changes to the password would have to be done in the web-management-console
                  (it seems esb readsd/writes the password in its light/internal db)
          
          trigger : 
            when redeploying CAR to ESB server
      
          steps that resulted to error : 
            - changed /user-mgt.xml, changed password of admin from 'admin' to 'Seer806*)^'
            - accordingly updated pom.xml password
            
          error :

          changes done not resulted to fix :
            changed pom.xml for CAR
