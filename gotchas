A) ESB syntax

  - endpoints [outgoing requests to back-end]
    - property 'REST_URL_POSTFIX' must be set to 'remove' to avoid trailing [forward] slash
      trailing foward slashes might cause error 'not found' on servers (like tomcat)
        (this is probably because those url ending in forward-slash are treated [diffently] as a resource per RFCxxxx)
        (ESB however, will handle incoming requests gracefully witht or without forward slash)
    
      example:
        localhost:8280/integra/tasks  - wont result to error
        localhost:8280/integra/tasks/ - will result to server 'not found' error,  when using [default settings] of tomcat

  - not coding <send/> in the out-sequence might case payload not to be send to the client/user
  - call mediator will only send a request but the esb will not wait for the response
    send mediator has to be used to send the payload back to the client/user

  - API
    - url-mapping will accept the specified pattern *plus* any query appended (just like specifying * but it won't allow f-slashes)
      if resource is /pizza, it will still catch /pizzas?flavor=cheese but not /pizzas/flavors
      (this seems to not apply to uri-template)
  

B) Developer Studio

  1.  dev-studio will generate <out/> even when there are no mediators specified for the out-sequence
      <out/> will cause failure of sending payload to the cilent/user
      add a send mediator inside </out> <send/> </out> to fix
        - if this does not work try to add add log-mediator, then save+deploy, then just delete the log mediator back
        - [ could be just a redeploy lag though ]

  2.  DevStudio will not explicitly notify about errors when editing in XML-sourcecode.
      The source will be silently corrected/reverted which will result to the code with missing changes to be deployed to the server instead.
      
      To catch errors, switch between design view and source view and look for codes corrected by dev-studio


C) WSO server

  1. ESB_HOME/repository/conf/user-mgt.xml is only read at first server run
      - it seems the value from the xml is stored at the db, user-mgt.xml is never read again 
      - user 'admin' can be easily configured (password can be changed) through the 'web mgt console' anyway
