A) ESB syntax

  - endpoints
    - property 'REST_URL_POSTFIX' must be set to 'remove' to avoid trailing [forward] slash
      trailing foward slashes might cause error 'not found' on servers (like tomcat)
    
      example:
        localhost:8280/integra/tasks  - wont result to error when using [default settings] of tomcat
        localhost:8280/integra/tasks/ - will result to server 'not found' error

  - not coding <send/> in the out-sequence might case payload not to be send to the client/user
  - call mediator will only send a request but the esb will not wait for the response
    send mediator has to be used to send the payload to the client/user



B) Developer Studio

  1.  dev-studio will generate <out/> even when there are no mediators specified for the out-sequence
      <out/> will cause failure of sending payload to the cilent/user
      add a send mediator </out> <send/> </out> to fix
