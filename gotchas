A) ESB syntax

  - always take note of the scope of the mediator 
      mainly used are 'synapse' and 'axis2'
      
      if you set a property and it seems to not take effect, setting the scope to axis2 usually fixes it

  - endpoints [outgoing requests to back-end]
    - property 'REST_URL_POSTFIX' must be set to 'remove' to avoid trailing [forward] slash
      trailing foward slashes might cause error 'not found' on servers (like tomcat)
        (this is probably because those url ending in forward-slash are treated [diffently] as a resource per RFCxxxx)
        (ESB however, will handle incoming requests gracefully witht or without forward slash)
    
      example:
        localhost:8280/integra/tasks  - wont result to error
        localhost:8280/integra/tasks/ - will result to server 'not found' error,  when using [default settings] of tomcat

  - not coding <send/> in the out-sequence might case payload not to be send to the client/user
  - call mediator will only send a request but the esb will not wait for the response
    send mediator has to be used to send the payload back to the client/user

  - API
    - url-mapping resource patterns without asterisk will also accept query-parameters postfixed to it 
       (just like specifying * but it won't allow forward-slashes)
        
        ex: if resource is /pizza, it will still catch /pizzas?flavor=cheese but not /pizzas/flavors
        
    - uri-template resource patterns without asterisk will not accept query-parameters postfixed to it
        
        ex 01 : if resource is /pizza won't catch /pizzas?flavor=cheese
        ex 02 : if resource is /pizza* will catch /pizzas?flavor=cheese
        
    - resource with url-mapping will still be able to get the query parameter (using 'get-property('query.param.xxx'))
        - get-property('uri.var.xxx') wont work though 

B) Developer Studio

  1.  dev-studio will generate <out/> even when there are no mediators specified for the out-sequence
      <out/> will cause failure of sending payload to the cilent/user
      add a send mediator inside </out> <send/> </out> to fix
        - if this does not work try to add add log-mediator, then save+deploy, then just delete the log mediator back
        - [ could be just a redeploy lag though ]
  

  2.  DevStudio will not explicitly notify about errors when editing in XML-sourcecode.
      The source will be silently corrected/reverted which will result to the code with missing changes to be deployed to the server instead.
      
      To catch errors, switch between design view and source view and look for codes corrected by dev-studio
      To test the deployment, look at the codes deployed to the server using the web-mgmt-console (web-ui)

C) WSO server

  1. ESB_HOME/repository/conf/user-mgt.xml is only read at first server run
      - it seems the value from the xml is stored at the db, then user-mgt.xml is never read again 
      - user 'admin' can be easily configured (password can be changed) through the 'web mgt console' anyway
