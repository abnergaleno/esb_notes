    re: git
        - no branches                                   - yes for now
        - commit directly to master branch ?            - yes for now 

    re: IntegraESB project
        - if no transformation is needed, do we need to store url chunks in properties and then re-pass them
            * html request url and body seems to be intact when passing through ESB-server
        - do we need to also specify the url mappings in the ESB ?
            if we need to specify every
                                            /obsv-pts/1/photos
                                            /obsv-pts/1/outcrops
                                            /obsv-pts/1/_________
            ... it could mean any API access won't be available until the ESB is also updated
          


probable suggestions:          

    re: IntegraESB project
        - prefix API names with module-code like GlTaskService instead of TaskService
            to easily sort API [by modules]
