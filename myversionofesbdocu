How to expose ESB:

  Proxies
    - probably well suited for WSDL(soap) esb-front <--> REST back-end
        - routing to REST backend can be done using SWITCH mediator,
          evaluating the soap action [expression : get-property('Action')] in the soap header
          
        - wsdl-2 (old name for wsdl-2 is wsdl-1.2)
  API
    - useful for grouping disparate^[change-term?] resources

  Scopes
    Synapse   - accessible both in and out sequences
                  example :   payload mediator set in in sequence will be accessible in out sequence 
    Axis*     - property / payload will lives only in 'IN sequence' or 'OUT sequence'
