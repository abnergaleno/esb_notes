How to expose ESB:

  Proxies
    - probably well suited for WSDL(soap) esb-front <--> REST back-end
        - wsdl 1 :  
                    * more probable
                    routing to REST backend can be done using SWITCH mediator,
                    evaluating the soap action [expression : get-property('Action')] in the soap header
                    
        - wsdl-2 :  
                    not tested
                    (old name for wsdl-2 is wsdl-1.2)
                    use the http binding to connect directly to REST 
  API
    - useful for grouping disparate^[change-term?] resources

  Scopes
    Synapse   - accessible both in and out sequences
                  example :   payload mediator set in in sequence will be accessible in out sequence 
    Axis*     - property / payload will lives only in 'IN sequence' or 'OUT sequence'
